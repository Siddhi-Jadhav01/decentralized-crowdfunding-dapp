# decentralized-crowdfunding-dapp

I built a decentralized crowdfunding platform where funds are locked in a smart contract. Contributors’ money is only released milestone-wise after approval. If the funding goal isn’t met by the deadline, contributors can automatically claim refunds. This removes trust from intermediaries and ensures transparency.
