# 🧱 Decentralized Milestone-Based Crowdfunding Platform

A decentralized crowdfunding platform where contributors’ funds are **securely locked in a smart contract** and **released only when predefined milestones are completed**.  
If the funding goal is not achieved, contributors can **automatically claim refunds**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional crowdfunding platforms require users to **trust intermediaries** to handle funds honestly.  
This can lead to:
- Misuse of funds
- Lack of transparency
- Delayed or denied refunds

---

## ✅ Solution

This project removes the need for trust by using **blockchain smart contracts** that:
- Lock funds securely
- Release money step-by-step based on milestones
- Automatically refund contributors if conditions are not met

All rules are enforced **automatically** and **cannot be altered**.

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

1. A creator creates a crowdfunding campaign with:
   - Funding goal
   - Deadline
   - Milestones (work stages)

2. Contributors send funds to the campaign.

3. Funds are locked in a smart contract.

4. After completing each milestone:
   - The corresponding amount is released to the creator.

5. If the funding goal is not met before the deadline:
   - Contributors can claim an automatic refund.

## 🪜 Example Scenario

A creator needs ₹10,000 for a project:

| Milestone | Description        | Amount |
|---------|--------------------|--------|
| 1       | Planning & Design  | ₹3,000 |
| 2       | Development        | ₹4,000 |
| 3       | Testing & Launch   | ₹3,000 |

Money is released **only after each stage is completed**.
